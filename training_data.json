After more than a decade of denials, he confessed to 30 murders committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978. His true victim total is unknown.[6]Bundy often employed charm to disguise his murderous intent when kidnapping victims, and extended this tactic vis-à-vis law enforcement, the media and the criminal justice system to maintain his claims of innocence. His usual technique involved approaching a female in public and luring her to a vehicle parked in a more secluded area, at which point she would be beaten unconscious, restrained with handcuffs and taken elsewhere to be sexually assaulted and killed.To this end, Bundy typically simulated having a physical impairment such as an injury in order to convince his target that he was in need of assistance with something, or would dupe her into believing he was an authority figure. He frequently revisited the bodies of those he abducted, grooming and performing sex acts on the corpses until decomposition and destruction by wild animals made further interactions impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, keeping their severed heads as mementos in his apartment. On a few occasions, he broke into homes at night and bludgeoned, maimed, strangled and/or sexually assaulted his victims in their sleep.In 1975, Bundy was arrested and jailed in Utah for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault. He then became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in several states. Facing murder charges in Colorado, Bundy engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults in Florida, including three murders, before his ultimate recapture in 1978. For the Florida homicides, he received three death sentences in two trials, and was executed at Florida State Prison in Raiford on January 24, 1989.Biographer Ann Rule characterized him as \"a sadistic sociopath who took pleasure from another human's pain and the control he had over his victims, to the point of death and even after.\"[7] Bundy once described himself as \"the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you'll ever meet\",[8][9] a statement with which attorney Polly Nelson, a member of his last defense team, agreed. \"Ted\", she wrote, \"was the very definition of heartless evil.\"[10]Theodore Robert Bundy (né Cowell; November 24, 1946 – January 24, 1989) was an American serial killer who kidnapped, raped and murdered dozens of young women and girls during the 1970s and possibly earlier.

If we think of the $X$ 's as having received a treatment and the $Y$ 's as being the control group, the effect of the treatment is characterized by the difference $\\mu_{X}-\\mu_{Y}$. A natural estimate of $\\mu_{X}-\\mu_{Y}$ is $\bar{X}-\bar{Y}$; in fact, this is the mle. Since $\\bar{X}-\\bar{Y}$ may be expressed as a linear combination of independent normally distributed random variables, it is normally distributed:$$\bar{X}-\bar{Y} \\sim N\\left[\\mu_{X}-\\mu_{Y}, \\sigma^{2}\\left(\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{m}\\right)\\right]$$If $\\sigma^{2}$ were known, a confidence interval for $\\mu_{X}-\\mu_{Y}$ could be based on$$Z=\\frac{(\\bar{X}-\bar{Y})-\\left(\\mu_{X}-\\mu_{Y}\\right)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{m}}}$$which follows a standard normal distribution. The confidence interval would be of the form$$(\\bar{X}-\\bar{Y}) \\pm z(\\alpha / 2) \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{m}}$$This confidence interval is of the same form as those introduced in Chapters 7 and $8-$ a statistic ( $\\bar{X}-\\bar{Y}$ in this case) plus or minus a multiple of its standard deviation.Generally, $\\sigma^{2}$ will not be known and must be estimated from the data by calculating the pooled sample variance,$$s_{p}^{2}=\\frac{(n-1) s_{X}^{2}+(m-1) s_{Y}^{2}}{m+n-2}$$where $s_{X}^{2}=(n-1) \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(X_{i}-\\bar{X}\\right)^{2}$ and similarly for $s_{Y}^{2}$. Note that $s_{p}^{2}$ is a weighted average of the sample variances of the $X$ 's and $Y$ 's, with the weights proportional to the degrees of freedom. This weighting is appropriate since if one sample is much larger than the other, the estimate of $\\sigma^{2}$ from that sample is more reliable and should receive greater weight?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Question: What assumptions are made about the samples in this context?Answer: The samples are assumed to be drawn from normal distributions with different means but the same variance.Question: How is the treatment effect characterized?Answer: The treatment effect is characterized by the difference in means ($\\mu_{X} - \\mu_{Y}$) between the treatment group and the control group.Question: What is the natural estimate of the treatment effect?Answer: The natural estimate of the treatment effect is the difference between the sample means: $\\bar{X} - \\bar{Y}$.Question: What is the distribution of $\\bar{X} - \\bar{Y}$?Answer: $\\bar{X} - \\bar{Y}$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu_{X} - \\mu_{Y}$ and variance $\\sigma^{2} \\left(\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)$.Question: How can a confidence interval for $\\mu_{X} - \\mu_{Y}$ be constructed if $\\sigma^{2}$ is known?Answer: A confidence interval can be constructed using the standard normal distribution and the formula: $(\\bar{X} - \\bar{Y}) \\pm z(\\alpha/2) \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}}$.Question: What is the pooled sample variance and how is it calculated?Answer: The pooled sample variance, $s_{p}^{2}$, is calculated by taking a weighted average of the sample variances $s_{X}^{2}$ and $s_{Y}^{2}$, where the weights are proportional to the degrees of freedom.
